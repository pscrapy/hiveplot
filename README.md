# hiveplot

Single-class python library for creation of [hiveplot](http://www.hiveplot.com/) data visualizations for graph data.
Starting from a pandas DataFrame containing the node adjacency table the class creates the links visualization using bezier curves.

The library only supports 3-class graph partitioning in order to avoid link overlap.

Currentrly only single-node insertion is implemented with bulk import planned.

*PS* The library is very much still a work in progress!
